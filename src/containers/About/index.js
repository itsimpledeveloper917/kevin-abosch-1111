        <p>
          1111 NFT digital works comprised of cryptographic alphanumerics
          presented in various compositions and colors. Individually and
          collectively, the works are embedded with and within a decentralized
          autonomous organization (DAO).
        </p>
        <p>
          Over time, it will be revealed how communities from around the world
          can interact with the work, with an emphasis on redefining the
          attention economy. Collectors are advised to “pay attention”
          themselves as this work is full of surprises!
